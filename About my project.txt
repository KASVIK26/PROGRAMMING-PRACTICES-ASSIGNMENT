Project Title: Interactive Quiz Application

Introduction:
Your interactive quiz application is a user-friendly program that provides users with a platform to test their knowledge in various categories. It is implemented using Python and the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI). The application incorporates features for user registration, login, category selection, quiz-taking, and scoreboard display.

Key Components and Functionality:

User Registration and Login:

The application offers users the ability to register their names. This process is vital for tracking individual scores.
User data is stored in the user_db dictionary, associating each user's name with itself.
Scores are tracked in the scoreboard dictionary, with initial scores set to zero upon registration.
Users can log in with their registered names using the "Login" button, which verifies their identity for quiz participation.
Quiz Categories:

Users can choose from a range of quiz categories. The available categories are predefined, including "General Knowledge," "Science," "History," and "Programming."
This feature allows users to tailor the quiz to their interests and expertise.
Taking a Quiz:

Upon login and category selection, users can start the quiz by clicking the "Start Quiz" button.
The application generates a set of random questions from the chosen category, enhancing variety and challenge for each quiz.
Each question is presented in a separate window, displaying the question text and multiple-choice answer options.
Users make their selections and submit their answers through these windows.
Users' scores are updated in real-time based on the number of correct answers.
Displaying Scoreboard:

The application offers a "Display Scoreboard" button, allowing users to view the scores of all registered users.
The scoreboard is sorted in descending order of scores, providing a friendly competition among users.
Users can see their rankings and track their progress over time.
Score Tracking:

User scores are maintained in the scoreboard dictionary, where each user's name is associated with their corresponding score.
This feature encourages users to participate repeatedly, improving their scores and aiming to top the leaderboard.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):

The GUI is developed using Tkinter, a popular Python library for building graphical interfaces.
It enhances the user experience by providing an intuitive and visually appealing platform for interacting with the application.
